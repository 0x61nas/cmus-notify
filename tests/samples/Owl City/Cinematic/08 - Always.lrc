[01:06.57]And you can hear the angels say
[01:09.53]Help is on the way
[01:13.02]The moment you begin to pray
[01:16.13]When the thunders roar
[01:19.50]You don't need to be afraid
[01:22.66]I'll lead you through the storm
[01:26.06]So please remember when I say
[01:29.68]I'm with you always
[01:56.59]
[01:56.59]When you are worn out
[02:00.06]And you are let down
[02:03.08]Remember I am just a prayer away
[02:09.87]When every door is locked
[02:13.00]And you feel so lost
[02:16.41]Remember I am just a prayer away
[02:22.73]
[02:22.73]Hold fast, I'll guide you through the night
[02:28.94]And fear not for I am by your side
[02:35.81]
[02:35.81]Listen through the rain
[02:39.06]And you can hear the angels say
[02:42.38]Help is on the way
[02:45.77]The moment you begin to pray
[02:48.61]When the thunders roar
[02:52.22]You don't need to be afraid

[03:08.30]Come and walk with me, yeah
[03:14.42]Come and talk with me, yeah
[03:21.12]Soar on eagles' wings
[03:25.38]Run and not be faint
[03:32.16]
[03:32.16]Listen through the rain
[03:35.44]And you can hear the angels say
[03:38.49]Help is on the way
[03:41.84]The moment you begin to pray
[03:45.06]When the thunders roar
[03:48.50]You don't need to be afraid
